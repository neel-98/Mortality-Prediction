# Mortality-Prediction

During the early COVID time, there was a shortage of beds in the Hospitals due to very high transmitibility rate of Coronavirus, which results into high mortality rate. To solve this problem, identifying the patients who are most vulnerable and giving them a priority can minimize the death rate. This can be kind to solution, as most of the patients can be cured at home and no need to hospitalized unless necessary. 

This project also concentrate on other Dataset : SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure assessment) Scores, which mainly concentrate on 6 major organs which are constantly monitored in the ICU. 

So this project is about identifying those patients with the help of machine learning techniques. It is divided into 2 parts, firstly identifying whether the patient is going to die or not which is classsification problem, and second part is about regression problem which finds if the patient is goihng to die then what are the approx days he/she has left.

This project followed the data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, data modelling and finally training the model. Each model is then evaluated and best model is selected for the prediction purpose. These models are then used by flask application in the UI side to do prediction and show predicted results.
